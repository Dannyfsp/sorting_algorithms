A readme on Sorting algorithms and Big O project given by ALX.

The tasks to this project is being solved on by Aghogho Bogare and Moses Erhinyodavwe

Learning Objectives:
At the end of this project, we are expected to be able to explain to anyone without the help of Google:
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm
